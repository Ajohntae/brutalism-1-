    <p style="text-align:center;"> <h1>this is a <strong>brutalist</strong> webpage.</h1>
   <h2>with webpages like this, there's a focus on<strong> form </strong> over funtion</h2> 
   <p> there's no hero page.</p>
   <p>what you see is what you get.</p>

   <p>the old reddit design is what brutalist webdesign is about;</p>
   <p> you understand what each part of the page does at first glance.</p>
   <p> the new reddit, has a focus on a more streamlined mainstream appeal.</p>
   <p> With a similar UI to most modern social sites. (i.e Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr.)</p>
   <p>and oftentimes i'll gush over those design principals.</p>
   <p>but when the standout features that distinguish your social site from others are inaccessible.</p>
   <p> it speaks towards a need for a different approach.</p>
   <p> this is </p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com"> new reddit</a>
   <p>i don't use it.</p>
   <p> you shouldn't either.</p>
